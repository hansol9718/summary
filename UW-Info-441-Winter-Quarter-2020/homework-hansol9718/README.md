# INFO 441 Challenges

This repo was automatically created for you by GitHub Classroom. **DO NOT FORK THIS REPO INTO YOUR OWN ACCOUNT!** Instead, clone this repo to your development machine by using `git clone <git url>` command. 

## Is this repo private? Can other students see my code? 

Don't worry, it is already private. Only you and the teaching team can see the code in this repo. You push your work to this repo. Please make all of your commits to branches in this repo.

## Where do I put my work? 
For each challenge, check out the branch listed in the Canvas assignment description. Make all commits for a given challenge only to that challenge branch, and push that branch up to GitHub. 

## How do I submit my work? 
When you are finished with challenge, [create a GitHub Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/), asking to merge all commits from your challenge branch back into the `master` branch. You do this from the Github.com UI, not from command line. 

After you create the pull request, we will do a code review to provide detailed inline feedback on your code. 

Note that you can still add commits to the branch after you create the pull request, and those new commits will be automatically added to the pull request as long as it's still open.
